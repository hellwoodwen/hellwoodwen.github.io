this is the very first entry in this repo, in my local machine.
Now you can see how can seven years being out of the code development world
let people need to learn to use basic stuff like github xD
I that time we used to use subversion and there wasn't such things
like github xD

Anyway... enjoy! this file will end up desapearing anyway xD
