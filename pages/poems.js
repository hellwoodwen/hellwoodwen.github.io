                            Looked down upon by the children of goldsmith<br />

                            A plume of silk<br />
                            Sitting afloat as a saviour<br />
                            Dark sarcasm and sweet love<br />

                            Overflowing imageries turn into disgust<br />
                            Youth start with the folly of admirations<br />
                            End with thorough understandings</p>

                            Always easier to write on back than on the front<br />
                            Life has loops and you can break
                            <br />
                            From the back<br />
                            Wick it or wreck it<br />
                            Jump up after a while as zombie revival
                            <br />
                            Or flying dutchman<br />
                            Only because the world is mad<br />
                            Doesn’t mean you have to be the same<br />
                            The world is not going to change<br />
                            And so do I<br />
                            Me - an earthly grown northern American califlower<br />
                            Silent killer<br />
                            Cocaine powder<br />

                        <p>I might look like sliding<br />
                            Or people think that way
                            <br />
                            In fact I am surfing

                            it’s freer without trail

                            the tides go up and down<br />
                            I can predict the direction<br />

                            it is good to have servers of different functions in networks<br />
                            noblesse, pride, and supremacy ought to be buried with feudalism, imperialism, and monarchy<br />
                            There are rotten people living in the world with crowns<br />
                            zombies a.k.a mummies from beneath the pyramids<br />
                            disguise as persons of importance
                            <br />
                            when all their actions are a mere decoration
                            <br />
                            they are criminals producing fantasies for those who are looking back at the old days
                            <br />
                            one leg in the tomb and the other struggling to survive
                            <br />
                            live in constant fluxes<br />
                            and you won’t have any problems of life and death, nor money, nor love<br />

                            <br />
                            Vikings navigate via the stars and their gods
                            <br />
