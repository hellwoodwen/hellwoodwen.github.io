                            From the back<br/>

                            And so do I<br/>

                            it’s freer without trail

                            I can predict the direction<br/>

                            it is good to have servers of different functions in networks<br/>
                            noblesse, pride, and supremacy ought to be buried with feudalism, imperialism, and monarchy<br/>
                            There are rotten people living in the world with crowns<br/>
                            zombies a.k.a mummies from beneath the pyramids<br/>
                            disguise as persons of importance
                            <br/>
                            when all their actions are a mere decoration
                            <br/>
                            they are criminals producing fantasies for those who are looking back at the old days
                            <br/>
                            one leg in the tomb and the other struggling to survive
                            <br/>
                            live in constant fluxes<br/>
                            and you won’t have any problems of life and death, nor money, nor love<br/>
